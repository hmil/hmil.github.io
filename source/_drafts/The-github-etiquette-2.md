No seriously. If you ever follow any of these advice you are a dick and you deserve to be treated like so.

The reality, as I have seen in many project, is that open source project maintainers are unsung heroes of today's world. They spend countless hours maintaining software that they barely use, and that they make available to anyone for anything, including profit.

Once a project is on track, it takes forever to make even the slightest change. I have seen people behaving like complete jackasses, assuming that the project maintainer is providing professional-grade support to users.

In reality, project maintainers have a life outside of coding. They do not have time to deal with each and everyone's individual problems. They are just random people who like to code and happen to have coded something useful to others. They never wanted to have huge success even though they sometimes do. One might think that as a project gains popularity it gains support, but that is biased. In fact, the need for support grows way faster than the actual support as the user base of a project grows.
You can easily see this by comparing a small, medium and large project. The backlog of large project is just insane. Full of unclosed issues with people arguing over the bikeshed.

People take open source projects for granted and imagine that the maintainers have some holy power that allows them to read through the lines of code and get the real meaning of the software. 

As a user of such software, it is **your duty** to contribute back. Contributing may be way easier than you think. Contributing to an open source project is doing **anything** which can be useful to other users of the project.

Take for example a bug report. Say you download a tool and it won't run. If you open an issue and say "The tool won't run on my machine" you are a jackass. If, instead, you open a comprehensive issue with a description of your system, the steps to reproduce the bug and some form of log trace, then you actually made a contribution to open source. For starters, it you are likely to find a solution to your problem while you gather the information required to fill such report. Second, if you still haven't solved your problem at that point, then chances are that someone else will encounter the same problem. Documenting a bug is important because it helps funnel the flow of incoming feedback.

Some other examples of contribution are: writing documentation, answering other people's questions, suggesting features (but like for bug report, a feature request should come out of good thought, with knowledge of what to change to make it happen), providing a code change to solve an issue (even if you are not 100% about your changes or if you only have a partial solution).

The maintainer is just an arbiter and keeps the project from falling in pieces, that doesn't mean he is the sole content creator. Everyone is a developer on an open source project by providing code, asking good questions and giving answers, writing docs, providing usage feedback, etc.

Please keep this in mind when navigating the depths of GitHub and have fun coding!
