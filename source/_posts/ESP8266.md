## What is the ESP8266?

The ESP8266 is to the IoT hobbyist what ford was to the automotive industry. It features everything you would need, comes at a ridiculusly low price and is easy to use.

It has so many applications and there are so many ways to use it that it can be quite confusing for beginners. I found myself having a lot of troubles navigating the ecosystem and I had to spend a few days researching how to do the most basic things.

That's why I wrote this guide: It is an opinionated guide showing you what I believe is the *golden path to ESP8266 development*. **I will show you the fastest way to get the most value out of this nifty module, based on my experience and on what worked best for me.**

Quoting wikipedia here: 
> The ESP8266 is a low-cost Wi-Fi microchip with full TCP/IP stack and microcontroller capability produced by Shanghai-based Chinese manufacturer Espressif Systems.

Basically a microcontroller with wifi capabilities.

The chip itself is pretty useless to the hobbyist: It has timy SMD terminals, no antenna, and very little memory. Therefore, when people talk about the EPS8266, they generally mean *a board which harnesses the ESP8266 chip*. There is a vast ecosystem of such boards and that is where people usually get confused.

## Which module should I buy?

As we saw in the previous section, the ESP8266 needs at least an antenna, some memory and a breakout board so we can plug it in our beloved breadboards. In addition, it needs a few resistors to control the boot mode (more about that later), a UART device so we can talk to it and optionally a couple push buttons to make it more convenient to work with.

I will briefly discuss the more commonly found modules. If you want to *tl;dr*, just skip ahead to the end of this section.

### ESP-XX modules

These are the most basic and widespread modules for the ESP8266. Orignially built by a company called Ai-Thinker, they feature the bare minimum hardware you'll need.

![Modules of the ESP-XX family by ai-Thinker. From left to right: ESP-07, ESP-01 and ESP-12F](/assets/esp8266/ESP07_01_12F.png)

The ESP-01 is the oldest module in this familly. It features 4x2 2.5mm male pins which make it very easy to interface (note that you can not plug this directly in a breadboard as you will invariably short pairs of pins together). The web contains countless tutorials on this module so I will not discuss it further.

The ESP-12x series represents a complete redesign of the ESP-01, still by the same company. It fullfills **exactly the same role as the ESP-01**, but its interface is dramatically different. This module interfaces through 2mm solder pads, which means you will not be able to plug it in your trusty 2.5mm breadboard. It features an onboard antenna, just like the ESP-01, but is also shielded, which presumably enhances its immunity to RF interference. The most popular nowadays is the ESP-12f which boasts some "improved antenna performance".

The ESP-07 comes in the same form factor and pinout as the ESP-12f. The major difference we'll notice as hobbyists is that it doesn't have an antenna. Instead it features a *U.FL socket* in which you are supposed to plug an external antenna. This design has a [significantly better range](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYLN9qH0C84) while presumably consuming more power.

Both the ESP-12f and ESP-07 require an additional breakout board to convert the 2mm pins to 2.5mm.

There are more modules in this familly and you can take a look at [the list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266#Ai-Thinker_modules) if you are interested. I will not detail how to use these modules in this article as this would take a whole article on its own. Just know that I advise against using these modules directly, especially for beginners. I started with these modules and lost a couple days fixing silly issues that the NodeMCU board would have spared.


### The NodeMCU devkits

The [NodeMCU](http://nodemcu.com) project provides an open source software and hardware solution for working with the ESP8266. Despite being built specifically for the NodeMCU software, the hardware can also be used as a general purpose ESP8266 development kit. We will talk more about the software later.

The original design incorporates an ESP-12E module, a USB-to-UART converter, 5v to 3.3v voltage regulation, a couple push buttons for reset and flash mode, and exports a micro-usb port and 2 rows of 15 2.5mm DIP male pins. Needless to say it saves **a lot of effort** interfacing with the chip. Cost-wise it's between 0.5$ and 1$ more expensive than a bare ESP-12f. You need ~~all~~ most of the features on the board anyway so don't try to cut corners and just buy the board already.

**At a price tag of just over 3$, this is the only board you'll ever need for ESP8266-based projects.**

By virtue of open source hardware, you will find a lot of variations of the design online and will quickly get lost when shopping. While all boards have similar caracteristics, be aware that some models are impractically large and cover all 8 rows of small breadboards. Therefore, I recommend sticking with the one commonly found under the name "v2" (sometimes also "v1"). See the pictures below to know what to look for. You might also want to take a look at [this comparison](https://frightanic.com/iot/comparison-of-esp8266-nodemcu-development-boards/) published by the main contributor to the NodeMCU project.

![Two common NodeMCU boards found on AliExpress: the one on the left is branded as "v2", and the right "v3". Notice the pin labels on the v3 are horizontal and take up more space, making the board unnecessarily large.](/assets/esp8266/NodeMCU_v2_v3.png)

_Note: If you are wondering what NodeMCU has to do with Node.js, well... nothing._


## Which software can I use to program the ESP8266?

You should now have a better understanding of the hardware landscape surrounding the ESP8266. Well, that was just the beginning. The software side is even more diverse and confusing than that.
I will teach you the basic principles and show a couple of popular solutions. We will then go in depth into the solution that I found to be best for experienced programmers.

### No software

As surprising as it may seem, the ESP8266 is actually first meant to be used as a wifi peripheral, and not to be programmed directly!
It ships with a simple serial command interpreter, which means that you can do wifi communication just by sending commands from a terminal (or another microcontroller). For instance, this is how you connect to an access point, and make a GET request to `http://httpbin.org/ip`:

```
AT+CIPMUX=0
AT+CWMODE=1
AT+CIPSTART="TCP","httpbin.org",80
AT+CIPSEND=20
GET /ip HTTP/1.0


// Notice that the two line returns above are part of the HTTP request and should be in \r\n form
```

There is plenty of documentation about this interface on the web; therefore, we are going to keep this section short. In this post we are interested in programming the chip rather than using it as a mere peripheral. Why bother adding a 20$ arduino in the setup when the ESP8266 alone can handle everything for under $3?!

### Low-level C interfaces

This paragraph is key to understanding the diversity of the software ecosystem for the ESP8266, so pay attention.
Espressif systems (the manufacturer of the ESP8266) initially released a software development kit in C (the programming language) that people could use to program the chip. This SDK only had chinese documentation and was rather complex so for a long time it remained obscure and hard to use.
Nowadays, I believe the documentation has been translated to english and the hobbyist community was able to build powerful frameworks on top of it. **To the hobbyist, there is no point in using the low-level C libraries. The frameworks are much preferred**.

There are two components to this low level SDK: the "RTOS" version and the "SDK" version. A detailed explaination about the differences is way beyond the scope of this article, but just know that developers must chose one and stick with it. One allows you to program inside a real-time operating system, the other one hands over complete control to the programmer. Anyways, these details are not super relevant to us. Just know that the tools you'll use are based on one of these frameworks.

### Arduino

Of course it's a thing! Using the C SDK discussed above, a compatibility layer for arduino was developped. It allows one to program applications on the ESP8266 just like on a regular arduino.

No matter how attractive this idea is to you, let me warn you: **I do not think it is a good idea to use the Arduino framework to program the ESP8266**. The ESP8266 + arduino combo seems very popular (google around and you'll see), but I think this is mainly due to the authority of Arduino and the fact that many in the Arduino community aren't programmers, rather than the technical validity of the solution. Gee, you'll even see people hook up an arduino to the ESP8266's UART for applications that could _easily_ fit on the ESP8266 alone!

The Arduino programming model does not work well with the ESP8266's architecture.
In arduino, you are usually the sole user of the CPU and you do not care much about power consumption. This allows you to write procedural code in a busy loop, which is easy to understand and is what made arduino so successful to beginners.
On the ESP8266 on the contrary, you share CPU with the networking stack. Monopolize the CPU for too long and the network stack will crash. What's more, ESP8266 application are more likely to run off the grid, where battery life is critical: exit the busyloop model!
I salute the effort that has been put in making the ESP8266 as compatible as possible with existing arduino APIs but I think that it is the wrong approach to solving the problem. As we will see next, **it is much easier for Arduino enthusiasts to adopt the ESP8266 through to the NodeMCU stack than it is for the ESP8266 to fit in the Arduino world.**

I am not saying you can't use the Arduino stack. You can. But in my opinion you will be more productive and save time going directly for the NodeMCU stack.


### NodeMCU

This is the way I recommend. NodeMCU is an ambitious idea perfectly put in practice by [a group of talented programmers](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware/graphs/contributors). It solves the problems the arduino-based solution faces while providing an extremely user-friendly environment.

NodeMCU is a lua-based operating system for the ESP8266. It contains a lua runtime as well as binary modules to interface with the different hardware capabilities of the EPS8266. **It is the best tradeoff between user-friendliness and resource efficiency I am aware of**. Its programming model is event-based (the API looks very much like that of Node.js), which makes particularly efficient and suited for this chip. **Despite being based on a scripting language (lua), I found it to run more stable than arduino applications written in C!**.

Some people might be put off by having to learn lua. The fact is you do not need to know lua in order to use NodeMCU. You will mostly be copy-pasting snippets from the doc, and add a couple `function`s and `if` statements. The language is so easy to read and use that you can do basic modifications without any prior knowlege. Of course biggger modifications will require a bit of googling, but the time you spend learning lua is time you would spend working around limitations of the other solutions! Trust me, this is the way to go.

## Let's get hacking!

Alright, at this point you should be equipped with a NodeMCU board and be convinced that the NodeMCU software is the way to go. If you have another hardware setup, make sure you have a usb-to-uart adapter to communicate with your chip, and that you control the boot modes of the ESP8266 (todo: doc).

The initial setup consists in the following:
1. Download a binary image of the NodeMCU firmware
2. Flash the firmware to the chip
3. Verify that everything works fine

Then, the workflow to program an application is:
1. Edit some lua files
2. Send them to the board
3. Reboot the board
4. Go back to 1. until you are satsfied with the result

### Find your COM port

First you will want to find the COM port talking to your ESP8266 chip. The easiest way is to go into the arduino IDE, and look at the available options in _Tools_ > _Port_

TODO: insert screenshot

Select one at random, open the serial monitor (the magnifying glass icon on the top right). Make sure you select "115200 baud" and "both NL & CR" in the dropdown at the bottom of the screen. Then depending on what is currently flashed on the board, try these two commands: `print(node.info())` or else just `AT`. If the first one returns some numbers, then it means that the chip has already been flashed with a NodeMCU firmware (we are still going to replace it with our own). If the second command works, it means that the chip contains the default firmware by espressif (as discussed in the first section).

If none of them works, try another serial port. It could also be that the chip currently contains garbage and is not able to run anything, or that you booted in "flash mode" (todo: verify). If you are running a bare ESP-XX module, make sure to drive the TODO pins in "bootloader mode" as shown in table one. If you are using a NodeMCU board, press the "rst" button and try again.

[TODO: insert screenshot of communication]

Now that you know which com port talks to the ESP8266, **close the serial console**, go back to your terminal and create a variable called `PORT`. For instance, my port is `/dev/cu.usbmodem12341` so I type:

```
export PORT="/dev/cu.usbmodem12341"
```


### Initial setup

There is one major drawback with NodeMCU: The complete image with all existing modules is too big to fit on the chip! Therefore, you need to select which modules you need for a given application and create a custom image with only these modules.
Fortunately, there are shortcuts: First, the creator of NodeMCU offers a cloud build service which lets you generate custom images online. Just check the boxes you need, hit "Start your build" and you are all set.
Alternatively, I saved a copy of the firmware containing a collection of the most essential modules, which I use for almost all of my projects. You can [download it here](TODO).

Now that you have the image, it's time to flash it!


We will flash the image using a python script provided by the community: [esptool.py](https://github.com/espressif/esptool).

**All flashing operations happen in "flash" mode. To enter flash mode, hold the "TODO" button and then press "reset". The ESP8266 will reboot in flash mode. If you are running a custom hardware setup, drive the pins in "flash" mode in table _TODO_.**

First, erase the flash memory of the device by running:
```
python esptool.py --port $PORT erase_flash
```

**Now, reset your ESP8266 in flash mode again**, and proceed to flash the firmware:
(Note that at that point the chip will tend to reboot automatically in "bootloader mode". It might take some patience to get it to reboot in flash mode. I found that I sometimes need to disconnect the chip from the power source, and hold the "flash" button down while I connect it back to power).

```
esptool.py --port $PORT write_flash -fm dio 0x00000 nodemcu-essentials-2018-05-02-float.bin
```

Tadaa! You can now reboot your board one more time, in "normal" mode. It is ready to use!


### Application programming

From now on, we will use a program called [nodemcu-uploader](https://github.com/kmpm/nodemcu-uploader) to interact with the chip. Install it or just clone the repository somewhere. Test your setup with `nodemcu-uploader --version` (note: if you cloned the repo, you might need to `python /path/to/nodemcu-uploader.py --version` instead).

#### Exploring the interactive prompt

NodeMCU exposes a command prompt on its serial port which you can use to run arbitrary lua code on the chip. `nodemcu-uploader` actually uses this interface to interact with the chip. Let's open an interactive terminal with the chip to get a sense of how this works. Make sure you still have the `PORT` variable around, then run `nodemcu-uploader --port $PORT terminal`. This should open a terminal connected to your board!

Try the following command:

```
print('Hello world')
```

The device should respond by printing the string 'Hello world'. Awesome! Now how about we do a little bit of wifi?

Put your chip in `station` mode with:

```lua
wifi.setmode(wifi.STATION)
```

Then enter this to get a list of available wifi networks (it takes a few seconds to load).

```lua
wifi.sta.getap(1, function (t)
  for k,v in pairs(t) do
    print(k.." : "..v)
  end
end)
```

Now configure the chip to connect to your wifi network with the following command:

```lua
wifi.sta.config({ssid = 'YOUR_WIFI_NETWORK_NAME', pwd = 'YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD'})
```

Wait for a dozen seconds to give it time to connect, and then confirm that you are online using the following command:

```lua
print(wifi.sta.getip())
```

If this shows 'nil', it means that the NodeMCU did not succesfully connect. Check your wifi password or give it some more time


Now that our piece of awesomness is connected to the internet, let's make some HTTP requests!

```lua
http.get("https://istheinternetdown.com/", nil, function(code, data)
  if (code < 0) then
    print("HTTP request failed")
  else
    print(code, data)
  end
end)
```

You should get a response telling you that the internet is not down (hopefully) and return your public IP address.

You can now quit the interactive session. (Note that this terminal's retarded exit sequence is "CTRL+]". If you are using a non-US keyboard use CTRL + _whatever key is next to the return key_)

#### Uploading a real program

Now that you have a sense of how the NodeMCU terminal interface works, let's write a real program and upload it to the board.

First, create a file called `env.lua`. This file will contain your wifi credentials (this is useful to avoid checking secret credentials in source control).

```lua
-- env.lua
WIFI_SSID="YOUR_NETWORK_NAME"
WIFI_PASSWORD="YOUR_NETWORK_PASSWORD"
```

Then copy the following program into a file called `init.lua`

```lua
-- init.lua
-- Loads the WIFI_NETWORK and WIFI_PASSWORD secret variables
dofile('env.lua')

-- Connect to the wifi network
wifi.setmode(wifi.STATION)
wifi.sta.config({ssid = WIFI_SSID, pwd = WIFI_PASSWORD})


-- index of the gpio connected to the onboard LED
LED_PIN=4

gpio.mode(LED_PIN, gpio.OUTPUT)
gpio.write(LED_PIN, 1)

-- This will print IP informations upon successful connection
wifi.eventmon.register(wifi.eventmon.STA_GOT_IP, function(T)
    print('\n\tSTA - GOT IP'..'\n\tStation IP: '..T.IP..'\n\tSubnet mask: '..
    T.netmask..'\n\tGateway IP: '..T.gateway)
end)

-- Create a TCP server
sv = net.createServer(net.TCP, 30)

headers = 'Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\n'

-- Configure the server to print the data it gets and respond
-- with a greeting message
if sv then
  sv:listen(80, function(conn)
    conn:on('receive', receiver)
  end)
end

function receiver(sck, data)
    print(data)
    firstLine = string.sub(data, 0, string.find(data, '\n'))

    message = ''
    if string.match(firstLine, 'GET /on ') then
        message = '<pre>turned on!</pre>'
        gpio.write(LED_PIN, 0) -- Note that the led shows the inverse of the logic state of the gpio
    elseif string.match(firstLine, 'GET /off ') then
        message = '<pre>turned off!</pre>'
        gpio.write(LED_PIN, 1)
    end

    if string.match(firstLine, 'GET /') or message ~= '' then
        sck:send('HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n'.. headers .. '\r\n'..
                '<h1>Hello from ESP8266!</h1>' ..
                message ..
                '<a href="/on">Turn light on</a> - <a href="/off">Turn light off</a>')
    else
        sck:send('HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND\r\n'.. headers .. '\r\n'..
                'Not found.<br/><a href="/">Go back home</a>')  
    end
    sck:on('sent', function () sck:close() end)
end

```

Finally, upload both files to the board using nodemcu-uploader:

```
nodemcu-uploader --port $PORT upload env.lua init.lua
```

When you reboot your board, it will look for the file called "init.lua" and run that program. It is useful for debugging purposes to connect to the terminal with `nodemcu-uploader --port $PORT terminal` while your board is booting. This shows a bunch of info as well as any `print` statement you put in your code.

Here is what I got:
```
--- Miniterm on /dev/cu.usbmodem12341  115200,8,N,1 ---
--- Quit: Ctrl+] | Menu: Ctrl+T | Help: Ctrl+T followed by Ctrl+H ---
[some redacted garbage characters. This is a normal behavior of the ESP8266]

_Excuse messy breadboard. None of it would have been necessary had I simply bought the NodeMCU devkit. Hopefully I made this mistake so you won't have to._

This test program lets you control the onboard LED through an HTML interface. Note that I tested this with the ESP-07. It should also work with the ESP-12 as well as any ESP-XX based NodeMCU board where the onboard LED is connected to `GPIO2`. Other hardware may have the LED connected to a different pin or not have an LED at all.

## You are on your own now

That's it for this tutorial. You now know the basics of the ESP8266 and have a complete development setup that allows you to write any IoT application! Let me give you some additional resources and tips before you leave:

The [nodemcu documentation](https://nodemcu.readthedocs.io/en/master/en/modules/gpio/#gpiomode) is your ultimate resource to learn all of the NodeMCU APIs. It is extremely powerful and I found it to be generally intuitive to use. That being said, keep in mind that when you run an application on the ESP8266, you are pushing it to its limits. Besides the network stack, it has very limited features and processing power. Even basic HTTP stuff is poorly supported. I advise you use [MQTT](TODO link) instead, a messaging protocol adapted to IoT applications. [It is possible to run an HTTP application server on the ESP8266]() but that is a complete abuse of the chip and should never be attempted in an application you intend to deploy.

In case you do not want to put all of the pieces together yourself, or if you get stuck somewhere, I provide the "works for me" package: a zip archive containing everything you need to run the experiments shown in this tutorial.

The archive also contains a Makefile which contains helpful tasks for NodeMCU development.

I still can not believe the amount of features that come with the ESP8266 as such a low price tag. The NodeMCU stack is like icing on the cake to me as it makes the programming part of such projects a blast! I feel inspired to build lots of IoT stuff and I hope it you do too.
I invite you to check out the [fish feeder](https://github.com/hmil/betta-feeder) I built for my betta. Originally piloted by an arduino, I was able to make it more failure tolerant and enhance its logging capabilities by replacing the arduino with an ESP8266!

And you, what do you want to build with your ESP8266? I'd love to hear your ideas! Feel free to get in touch or share your thoughts in the comment section.
